# Traffic Object Semantic Segmentation

## Reason

This project is a class project that I am doing in my CS 469 - Intro to digital image processing class.
The topic I chose to make a project on is image semantic segmentation for traffic objects.

## Description

This project focuses on developing an advanced algorithm for identifying and separating vehicles, pedestrians, and traffic signs from images through image
processing techniques like image segmentation. This process can be very helpful for different
software such as autonomous vehicles and even traffic cameras and monitoring systems. With
methods of image segmentation, the goal is to accurately identify and mark these different traffic
objects.

## My approach

My approach proposes an approach of using semantic segmentation to identify
and separate vehicles, traffic signs, and pedestrians with deep learning. I will implement a
semantic segmentation model using pre-trained models like SegNet or DeepLabV3. With this
approach, I won't have to build and train my own models, and specifically focus on making the
pre-trained model more accurately identify these different common traffic objects.

## Dataset

One publicly available dataset I will utilize is from COCO, that include city images on
streets and sidewalks that include vehicles, pedestrians, and traffic signs. This dataset contains
123,287 images but I am able to filter images to only show traffic images which reduce the
number to under 3,000. Another public dataset I will be using is from Cityscapes which provides
5,000 images of urban street scenes. These datasets contain pixel annotations for object
segmentation which can be very helpful for my project
